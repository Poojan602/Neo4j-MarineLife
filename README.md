# Neo4j-MarineLife

## Project to explore the Neo4j database

- Data of marine animal was scraped from the website https://oceana.ca/en and stored in CSV using python
- The stored data was cleaned using python script
- The data was imported from the CSV file to Neo4j database
- Neo4j queries were written to create the relationship between the marine animals based on their habitat, whether the animal is endangered or not
